A new way to backup your android phone (via wireless) to your pc!

## What is?
[MTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol) is the tool provided by Windows to manage your phone files -or so their creators pretend-. After several frustrating attempts to use it, I decided to come to a different solution. I wrote a python script as a  secure and suitable way to transfer my files. By now it is only functional for phones using Android because [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb), the Android Debug Bridge, is the system I connected my devices through. Thus, it also works for Windows, Mac and Linux. Any other systems will depend on ADB disponibility -or on any similar tool-.
